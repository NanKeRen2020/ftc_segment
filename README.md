Fine-to-Coarse histogram segmentation algorithm with contrario approach 

and 1D histogram local integral for character segmention.


This project implements a fast and auto character segment algorithm in C++.

The character segment algorithm is based on the FTC (Fine-to-Coarse) algorithm for histogram

segmentation, presented by Delon et al. in 2007. This algorithm also uses a non-parametric a

contrario approach to segment the 1D histogram into its meaningful modes. Besides, this implement

adopt a new tirck which is called local integral to refine to find the minimums of 1D histogram

of canny edge image project.
